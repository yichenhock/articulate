# ARTiculate
*Use your voice to create art*

## What it does
Our project introduces a hands-free painting experience. Commands like `bold`, `down`, `go` and so on control the stroke. Going beyond just mimicking mouse-controlled paint apps, advanced features include voice-controlled colour mixing, "shortcuts" to jump between bounded regions of the painting, and a velocity-acceleration mode for the brush.

Try it out yourself [here](art-iculate.tech) (and discover a new meaning to a "a picture is worth a thousand words")!
